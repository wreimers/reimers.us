I am currently attending the 2019 LLVM Developer Meeting.

{{< tweet 1186677081595236352 >}}

After the first hour, spent listening to the keynote called "Generating Optimized Code with GlobalISel" my brain hurt, but... it was that good kind of pain you get after a particularly hard workout.

By the end of the day, after having seen several more talks, I was psyched up!

Naturally, when I went home after the first day, I immediately tried to build LLVM on my macBook Pro running macOS 10.14.6 Mojave, and with Xcode 11.1 installed.

## Before We Begin

Make sure you've launched Xcode at least once and it's completed the First Launch Experience, which includes accepting the license agreement. You can also accept using the command line:

```
$ sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

## System Headers

I'm runing Xcode 11.1, which comes with the macOS 10.15 Catalina SDK. According to [the Xcode 10.0 release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_release_notes), Apple has helpfully provided a package to install the system headers into /usr/include. You'll need these for the LLVM unit tests.

```
$ open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
``` 

This command will open the package installer UI for you so you can install the headers:

## Install Requirements

Homebrew has some flaws, but I just want dependency management to get out of my way and let me do work, and it's really excellent at that. 

I updated Homebrew and upgraded all of my installed software. What can I say? I like to live on the edge.

```
$ brew update
[...]
$ brew upgrade
[...]
$
```

This is all I had to do to get the tools I needed to build LLVM:

```
$ brew install cmake

```

## Clone, Configure, Build

Next, it was time to clone the repository.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:llvm/llvm-project.git

```

Whoo-baby, that's a monorepo behemoth. Next, I configured a build.

```
$ cd llvm-project
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake -G Ninja ../llvm/ \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" \
    -DLLVM_CCACHE_BUILD=On
[...]
-- Build files have been written to: /Users/liamr/Code/llvm-project/build
$
```

And now, we build! (And build and run all the tests.)

```
